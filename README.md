> A curated and collaborative list of Arabic speaker's contributions in tech.

[Arabic Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic) is the third most widespread official language after English and French! It has **380 million** native speakers of all varieties (2024).

## The Project

[Awesome Arabic Speaker](https://awesome-arabic-speakers.dev/) is an initiative to create a curated and collaborative list of Arabic Speakers' tech contributions regardless of ethnicity, nationality, or location. Also, the contributions don't have to be in Arabic to be useful and add value.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from everyone. The list covers many [categories](https://awesome-arabic-speakers.dev/categories/) like `Entity`, `Software`, `Multimedia`, `Text`, and `Event`.

Please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more details on how to contribute.
