# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the [Awesome Arabic Speakers](https://awesome-arabic-speakers.dev/) project. We appreciate your efforts and contributions.

## Criteria

Awesome Arabic Speakers is an awesome list. `Awesome` lists are curated of the best, **not everything**.

So, we define the criteria for contributions per category as follows (we probably will change it a bit over time):

- [Project](https://awesome-arabic-speakers.dev/categories/project/) (like organization or community): It should be established for at least a year and has a clear impact.
- [Software](https://awesome-arabic-speakers.dev/categories/software/) (like code): It should have between 100 and 200 stars on GitHub (or equivalent on other platforms).
- [Event](https://awesome-arabic-speakers.dev/categories/event/) (like conference): It should be conducted at least 2 times if it's yearly, 4 times if it's quarterly, and 8 times if it's monthly.
- [Multimedia](https://awesome-arabic-speakers.dev/categories/multimedia/) (like podcast, vodcast. or video tutorials): It should have around 10K subscribers.
- [Text](https://awesome-arabic-speakers.dev/categories/text/) (like blog): It should be live for over a year and has at least 12 posts.

Some exceptions may be allowed, but only in the narrowest limits (e.g., when the project is unique).
