[Syrian Open Source](https://github.com/Syrian-Open-Source) is a GitHub initiative to unite Syrian developers from diverse backgrounds to collaborate on open-source projects across various languages and versions. It seeks to encourage Syrian developers to contribute more to open-source software, enhance its quality and engineering, and promote the open-source concept within the Syrian software community. Additionally, the platform aims to boost developer efficiency by facilitating work on distributed systems and teams.
