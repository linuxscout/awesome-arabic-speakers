[Mishkal](https://github.com/linuxscout/mishkal) is an an open source Arabic text diacritization program that can be used in reading, teaching and disambiguation. This software goal is to provide the basic building blocks for building systems for processing the Arabic language and its various applications. The diacritization algorithms are approximate, and their results are inaccurate. Some texts have more than one state and require understanding the text. Therefore, the goal of Mishkal is to provide an initial diacritization and then provide suggestions that enable the diacritization to be modified.
